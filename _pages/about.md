I am a French engineer, graduated from ENSTA Paris (2014) and ENSAE (2017), and appointed as an administrateur at INSEE (2024).
Specialized in data science and economics, my research lies at the intersection of macroeconomics and machine learning.

Previously, I worked as a macroeconomist at the French Treasury (2017–2020) and am currently a consultant at the French Agency for Ecological Transition (2020–2026), where I develop large-scale models to generate long-term, climate-oriented economic scenarios.
