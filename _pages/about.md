I am a French engineer (ENSTA Paris, 2014; ENSAE, 2017) and a high-ranking civil servant at INSEE (2024), specializing in macroeconomics, climate economics, and data science. I have also been involved in several public statistics projects.

Previously, I worked at the French Treasury (2017–2020). Since 2020, I have been a macroeconomist at the French Agency for Ecological Transition, developing large-scale models to generate long-term, climate-oriented economic scenarios.

Passionate about leveraging data science and economic research to inform sustainable policies. Let’s connect!
